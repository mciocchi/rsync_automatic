** Rationale
   This script exists to provide checks, handlers, and logging that make rsync backups safer and more user friendly. In addition, it provides and uses a simple wrapper libary that uses locks to prevent multiple rsync processes from running at the same time and thrashing the disks of a system.
** Installation
*** 1 Make sure script source directory is mapped to $PERL5LIB environment variable or $PATH:
    export PERL5LIB=$PERL5LIB':/home/user/rsync_automatic'
*** 2 Set up configs in ./rsync_automatic/lib/config/ follow ./rsync_automatic/lib/config/example.pm for guidance.
*** 3 Make sure new configurations are imported and mapped to the confighandler in rsync_automatic.pl
*** 4 Optional: Point config to rotating daily backup directories 1 - 7 and set up rsync_automatic.pl to run as a cron or anacron.
